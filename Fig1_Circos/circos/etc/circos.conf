# The chromosomes_unit value is used as a unit (suffix "u") to shorten
# values in other parts of the configuration file. Some parameters,
# such as ideogram and tick spacing, accept "u" suffixes, so instead of
#
# spacing = 10000000
#
# you can write
#
# spacing = 10u
#
# See ticks.conf for examples.

chromosomes_units = 50000

# Colors are redefined by overwriting color definitions, which are
# found in the <colors> block. This block is included below from the
# colors_fonts_patterns.conf file, which contains all the default
# definitions. To overwrite colors, use a "*" suffix and provide a new
# value, which can be a lookup to another color.

<colors>

chr2* = 45,142,135
chr3* = 232,166,49

chr5* = 246,137,48
chr6* = 201,201,128

# Links are defined in <link> blocks enclosed in a <links> block. The
# links start at a radial position defined by 'radius' and have their
# control point (adjusts curvature) at the radial position defined by
# 'bezier_radius'. In this example, I use the segmental duplication
# data set, which connects regions of similar sequence (90%+
# similarity, at least 1kb in size).

# color         = green
